	I came across two articles this weekend that dealt with immigration
as an issue in the current U.S. presidential campaign.  The first
article written by The New York Time &ldquo;Explaining What Donald
Trump Wants to Do Now on Immigration&rdquo; was published on
September 1<SUP>st</SUP> 2016, discusses how Donald Trumps'
immigration policy is changing to be more like the one led by
president Obama. In the second article published by The Guardian on
September 6th 2016 talks about the Bosnian population within Missouri
possibly deciding which presidential candidate could win that state. 
Donald Trump will never win the Bosnian American vote if he focuses
his campaign on hate speech and strict immigration policies. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">	The presidential
nominee Donald Trump has modified his plan on immigration. The New
York Times wrote an article describing the modification of his
immigration plan which now consists of deporting two million illegal
immigrants who have had a criminal record, building a wall across the
Southern border, and 'sanctioning' countries and cities who do not
comply with his policies. Donald Trumps' original plan was the polar
opposite of Obama's by deporting all illegal immigrants no matter of
their criminal history and isolating the United States by closing the
borders. The article points out that Donald Trump is in fact
following current immigration policies set by President Obama.
Changing the plans for future immigration policies could be his way
of appealing to a broader voting population. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">	As a Bosnian
American I find Donald Trump's immigration stance appalling which is
better described by the recent article published by Guardian on
September 6<SUP>th</SUP> 2016, 'How Missouri's 'Bosnian vote&#8203;'
could cost Donald Trump &ndash; and turn the state blue.  The article
talks about a small group of muslim naturalized Americans who came as
refugees two decades ago that will help decide the presidential race
in the swing state of Missouri. Thousands of Yugoslavians fled the
violence during 1990's and settled in Mid-Western cities of Chicago
and St. Louis. The article states there are between 50,000 &ndash;
75,000 ethnic Bosnians in Missouri. American Bosnians make up a
powerful voting block of pro immigrant, pro Muslim supporters in a
state where Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump are tied in a voting
polls. Until recently Bosnian Americans were politically silent but
that has since changed in recent years. A brutal death of a young
Bosnian man on the streets of Saint Louis sparked protests and calls
for action from the Bosnian community. Local politicians have catered
to Bosnians by visiting their religious institutions and printing
political literature in Bosnian. Nationalistic extremists in the
former Yugoslavian countries have taken Trump's rhetoric &ldquo;Make
America Great Again&rdquo; and applied it to their country &ldquo;Make
Serbia Great Again&rdquo; to blame minority populations for their
countries problems. Donald Trump's controversial speeches and
policies are being passed onto countries that have historical
religious tensions and could be used to incite future violence. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">	Donald Trump is
currently losing in the presidential election polls to Hilary Clinton
- his chief rival. He is modifying his immigration policies to appeal
to a broader general population for more votes.  Mr. Trump has been
lessening the coercive stands towards illegal immigration within the
United States since the beginning of his campaign. Donald Trump
indicated his will of deporting every single illegal immigrant within
our borders regardless of their criminal history. Mr. Trump now says
he would deport only illegal immigrants that threaten national
security. Even with more moderate views on immigration Donald Trump
would not appeal to Muslim Americans due to his discrimination
against many minority groups.  To win the the electoral vote in
Missouri Donald Trump must win the hearts of the Bosnian diaspora
with other issues such as job creation or ending the conflicts in the
Middle East where Bosnians have a soft heart for ending the violence
in bloodshed.
