Balkan peninsula has never been completely stable. Former Yugoslavia was not
able to avoid the invasion from the Turks and Austrians, World Wars, or various
internal civil wars and divisions. After three bloody years, Bosnia and
Herzegovina claimed its independence from Socialist Yugoslavia on March 1,
1992. This landlocked country with only 20 kilometers of coastline of Adriatic
Sea borders with Croatia on north, west, and south, Serbia to the east, and Montenegro
to the southeast. The civil war in the 1990’s devastated the landscape of this
country and the previous flourishing economy (Hoare 2007). With the signing of
the peace treaty billions were pledged to rebuild and restart the economy of
this tiny European country. </p>

has never surpassed its beginning phase. The reformation into democratic Bosnia
by using neoliberal ideas began with structural reforms. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>The Dayton Peace Accord </i>established a colonial government in Bosnia
that took out billions of euros in loans to pay for its peace keeping forces
(Bose 2005). Former Swedish Prime Minister, Carl Bildt who was the head of
peace negotiations in Bosnia became the de facto chief executive of Bosnia
(Bildt 1998). The Bosnian Central Bank became controlled by the IMF, and all
public-sector enterprises (i.e. roads, railways, water, energy, and postal service)
were under European Bank control. Instead of a strong central government the
Dayton Peace Accord set up three separate government bodies based upon the
three ethnic nationalities. These separate governments would take turns being
the official federal government and have no jurisdiction in a separate
autonomous region of the country. As the war left Bosnia in ruins and <span
style='background:white'>everything in the country from the water supply to the
power and the telecommunications had to be reconstructed. This reconstruction
was to be paid for by loans given to Bosnia by international organizations in
exchange for institutional reforms. </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

new taxes, privatization, and other neo-liberalist ideas. &nbsp;High inflation
rates on these loans, poor timing on when these loans were created, and
indiscriminate structural adjustments with no respect to the problems faced by

period between 1996 to 2002, Bosnia’s annual aid was $730 million or $1,400 per

of reconstruction, these loans were used to pay for financing the costs of IFOR

NATO forces in Bosnia implemented to act as IFOR peacekeeping force. In
subsequent years other loans were issued but only to pay back interest incurred
from previous loans (Chossudovsky 2016). In June of 2017 Bosnia raised 17.3
million dollars in a new International Monetary Fund loan to help pay interests
on previous loans (International Monetary Fund 2016). The effects of these
loans and neoliberalist policies that dismantled the Bosnian infrastructure can
be easily seen by examining a local areas economy before and after the war. <span

employed workforce decreased dramatically in the last two decades. Valuable
industrial machinery that people once relied on for jobs was now sold out for
private gain. Previous industrial workers are now unemployed and dream of
emigration to western countries with healthier economies. Haris Gekic and Aida
Bidzan did a study on the change of industry in the Vrbas valley in the 20<sup>th</sup>
century. In 1987 the six main industries (textile, food, leather, footwear,
chemical and electrical) employed 8891 people. <span
class=apple-converted-space><span style='background:white'>&nbsp;Just before
the civil war broke out in 1991 the </span></span><span style='background:white'>“Slavko
Rodic” company employed 4000 workers. The Vrbas valley was a thriving and
prosperous region of Central Canton in Bosnia. In 1987 the number of employed
Bosnians was 421,320. In 2010 in contrast there were only </span>144,861
Bosnians who had jobs. In the Vrbas valley there were only 1,790 workers
employed in industrial sectors in 2010 (Gekic, Bidzan 2015). Up until 1992 when
war occurred industrial growth was expanding. After 1992 industrial production
almost stopped and the educated workforce left with it. Today Bosnia imports
roughly four billion dollars more than it exports (CIA WorldFactBook). Previous
to the war, during Tito’s governance Yugoslavia was a strong export economy.
Huge decline in the economy has been a main push factor for the Bosnian youth
causing a massive brain drain and shift to more traditional methods of
employment. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;

and Bosnia have to turn to traditional plots of land that have been previously
left abandoned. Previous to the industrial revolution at the turn of the 19<sup>th</sup><span

farmers who also produced one or two cash crops that can be used in exchange
for goods and services. With the collapse of the modern economy in Bosnia
people have turned to the old fashioned traditional money-making methods.

sizes of farms and the climate labor intensive high yield berry agriculture has
been popular. Families in Central Bosnia rely on agriculture for survival.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;

for almost all Bosnians as is it is heavily subsidized by the state. Summer is
the picking raspberries season and families need to get up very early before
the sun hits to pick the raspberries. This kind of work is not sparing to
children who spend their summer vacations on raspberry patches with their
parents. Instead of going to after school programs to remain competitive with
other industrialized countries Bosnian children instead work with their parents
on the farms to help generate family’s income.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;

civil war has been slowly changing the educated workforce. Before the war there
were four times as many job opportunities. After the war the brightest left to
seek their fortunes elsewhere leaving Bosnia causing a brain drain. Those who
stayed see high unemployment rates and turn to traditional methods of
employment including farming. Higher levels of learning are slowly being seen
as irrelevant and wasteful to the younger generations who see their future
following their parents’ footsteps in growing crops.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;
background:white'>In his book, “The Elusive Quest for Growth”, William Easterly
explains why international development loans did not work in Bosnia and other
countries needing to ‘jumpstart’ their economy after a disaster or war. In 1980
the World Bank began making loans that carried conditions for the recipient
country to change their economic policy. The IMF and World Bank gave an average
of 3 adjustment loans to each country in Eastern Europe in 1980’s. Instead of
the predicted 3.5 % increase in economy the average growth of developing
countries was at 0%.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Easterly found that
very little to no structural adjustment was created after the loans were
dispersed (Easterly 2002).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Easterly
generalizes when concluding his study on what a reconstruction needs to have to
be successful. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;
background:white'>A bad government according to Easterly could never achieve a
sustainable market economy. “An unchanged irresponsible government will create
an illusion of adjustment without doing the real thing (Easterly 2002).” The
Dayton Peace Accord created a government in which three separate governments
operated autonomously as a federal government in Bosnia along with a separate
semi-independent republic. The three governments rely upon ethnic nationalistic
identities to maintain their authority upon the people and the economy. For
example, in a small town in Central Bosnia, Jajce, two separate school systems
exist along ethnic divisions to service the area. Instead of minimizing the
cost two separate school systems i.e. teachers, administrators, books and
buildings double the cost of education in Bosnia. When students and their
parents protested this segregation school officials and government officials
ignored and ridiculed their claims. NATO Ambassador to Bosnia, Jonathan Moore
on the topic of two schools under one roof stated: “<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>When you have two schools instead of one, you have more jobs you can
hand to your own ethnic group or party members... When you have more schools,
it costs more money, but as long as they provide jobs for people connected to
political parties, than nobody cares about it (</i>Knezevic 2017).” Even with
this blatant discrimination and cronyism with the government of Bosnia refusing
to reform and cut such blatant excessive costs lenders such as the IMF continue
to send millions in additional loans to Bosnia. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;
background:white'>In” The Institutional Prerequisites for Post-Conflict
Reconstruction” by Coyne he outlines how economies can be rebuilt after a
military conflict. The institutional prerequisites that serve as fundamental
bodies of structural change are: “shared ideology and ethic of individual and
private property rights, a commitment to markets and the rule of law.” Without
the prerequisites to serve as a foundation <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>“reconstructed
liberal orders will fail to be self-sustaining over time</i>”. Coyne redefines
reconstruction as the creation and/or reconstruction of all the “<i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>infrastructure and facilities, minimal social
services, and structural reform and transformation in the political, economic,
social and security sectors”</i> (Coyne 2005).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Coyne mentions that peacekeeping is a subset but not the entirety of the
reconstruction process. In Bosnia the majority if not all of the reconstruction
funds went towards funding peacekeeping forces. The infrastructure and economy
was sold off by the IMF to the highest bidder to be privatized. The ultimate
goal of reconstruction as Coyne states, is a self-sustaining liberal democracy.
Twenty years after reconstruction began Bosnia is still receiving foreign aid
and cannot join the European Union membership because it fails to meet the
definition of a democracy. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;
background:white'>The resources and labor of Bosnia are being exploited by
world powers to grow their economies and political agendas. Serbian
nationalists are being exploited by Russia for their geopolitical interest in
Europe. Russian president, Vladimir Putin regularly meets with the president of
the autonomous Republic of Srpska within Bosnian borders to show its political
support and project power (Kovacevic 2016). German and Austrian companies
regularly open mining and manufacturing facilities in hard hit rural areas of
Bosnia. They exploit the minimum floor wages and low to minimum environmental
regulations to extract materials needed for luxury goods produced in Germany
and Austria.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Additionally, entrepreneurs
from the Middle Eastern countries such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, are building
and investing in luxury real state resorts to gain a foothold in European
economies. They are attracted by the Islamic friendly Bosnia in the heart of
Europe where prices are artificially low due to decades of negative economic
growth (Reporter 2016). <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>International
powers that are propping up competing nationalistic groups and do nothing more
than destabilize Bosnia further. The recent lack of attention paid by larger
international players such as United States due to their decade long military
conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan, and now Syria and Yemen is creating a tinder
box for a new conflict in the region. </p>

</span>Bosnia once had a robust and thriving economy under the communist Yugoslavia
with a socialist economy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Bosnia and the
International Community should be more concerned for diversifying the economy
so it does not rely upon small cash crops to survive. Low interest loans and
programs should be set up to encourage young entrepreneurs to set up internet
based businesses and children after school programs designed to promote
education in the new global economy. <span style='background:white'>Since 1996,
the World Bank has committed over $1.1 billion, while other World Bank agencies
had sent $500 million to Bosnia for economic development with little to no
increase in economic self-sufficiency.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>One of the first reforms that should be in place however should be the
removal of the bad government set up during the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

political and economic power to a self-sufficient nation with their interest at
heart and not that of other countries. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
