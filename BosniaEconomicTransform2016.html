                             <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Before the break up of Yugoslavia,
Bosnia and more particularly the Vrbas valley in Central Bosnia was
an industrial center.  <A HREF="http://www.savap.org.pk/journals/ARInt./Vol.6(2)/2015(6.2-17).pdf">Hairs
Gekic and Aida Bidzan wrote about the change of  industry in this
area during the 20<SUP>th</SUP> century.</A> In 1961 there were six
main industries in the upper Vrbas valley. In 1987 these industries
employed 8,891 people.  Textile, food, leather, footwear, chemical
and electrical industries diversified the regions economy. &ldquo;Slavko
Rodic&rdquo; company in 1991 employed 4000 workers.  The Vrbas valley
was a thriving and prosperous region of Central Canton in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> Damage and destruction during the
civil war along with widespread corruption have affected society of
Bosnia in many ways. The previous industries were no longer existent
and any valuable industrial machinery was sold out for private gain. 
Previous industrial workers are now unemployment and dream of
emigration. In 2010 only 1,790 workers were employed in industrial
sectors.  In Bosnia as a whole 421,320 workers were employed in 1987,
in 2010 only 144,861 had jobs. Up until 1992 when war occurred
industrial growth was expanding. After 1992 industrial production
almost stopped and the educated workforce left with it. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Unable to find employment many citizens
have to turn to traditional plots of land that have been previously
left abandoned.  Previous to the industrial revolution at the turn of
the 19<SUP>th</SUP> century most families were subsistence farmers
who also produced one or two cash crops that can be used in exchange
for goods and services. With the collapse of the modern economy in
Bosnia people have turned to the old fashioned traditional money
making methods. International organizations such as <A HREF="http://www.islamic-relief.org.uk/news/growing-raspberries-in-bosnia/">Islamic
Relief</A> and <A HREF="http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/Pnadl718.pdf">USAID</A>
have been developing markets for these new agricultural cash crops
and providing education and loans for farmers. Due to the small sizes
of farms and the climate labor intensive high yield berry agriculture
has been popular.  Families in Central Bosnia rely on agriculture for
survival. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The change in job opportunities from
factories to farms is affecting younger generations by promoting farm
work over white and blue collar opportunities. <A HREF="http://www.ruralpovertyportal.org/country/home/tags/bosnia_and_herzegovina">Most
Bosnians are literate and many are well educated.</A>  Almost all
children in Bosnia attend and graduate primary and secondary schools.
 College is attainable for almost all Bosnians as is it is heavily
subsidized by the state.  Summer is the picking raspberries season
and families need to get up very early before the sun hits to pick
the raspberries. This kind of work is not sparing children who spend
their summer vacations on raspberry patches with their parents.
Instead of going to after school programs to remain competitive with
other industrialized countries Bosnian children instead work with
their parents on the farms to help generate family&rsquo;s income. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The shift from industrial to
agricultural society after the civil war has been slowly changing the
educated workforce. Before the war there were four times as many job
opportunities. After the war the brightest left to seek their
fortunes elsewhere leaving Bosnia. Those who stayed see high
unemployment rates and turn to traditional methods of employment
including farming.  Higher levels of learning are slowly being seen
as irrelevant and wasteful to the younger generations who see their
future following their parents footsteps in growing crops.   Bosnia
and the International Community should be more concerned for
diversifying the economy so it does not rely upon cash crops to
survive.  Low interests loans and programs should be set up to
encourage young entrepreneurs to set up internet based businesses and
children after school programs designed to promote education in the
new global economy.
